<p>Everyone had such a good time bringing in the New Year at Rapids Theatre in Niagara Falls last year,</p>

<p>we&nbsp;are doing&nbsp;it again this year.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Yep, our&nbsp;concert at the&nbsp;Rapids Theatre&nbsp;has been&nbsp;moved to New Year's Eve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tickets for the Oct 28 show&nbsp;will be accepted on New Year's Eve. 12/31/2017</p>

<p>Join us.</p>

<p>It's going to be a riot.</p>
