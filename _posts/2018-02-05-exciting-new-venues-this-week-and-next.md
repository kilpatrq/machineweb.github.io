<p>It's really great to be playing a brand-new venue for The Machine --&nbsp;this Friday, the band plays for the first time at the fabulous new AURA in Portland, ME.&nbsp; Check out the interior&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/a/waterfrontconcerts.com/file/d/0B95bEHkC37zjb2hFZldpVHNLbTA/view">here</a>.</p>

<p>Next Friday, the 16th, we return to the Lebanon Opera House in New Hampshire for the first time in years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In between, we play one of our favorite small theaters, the Ridgefield Playhouse, in Ridgefield, CT.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since we are talking about New England, you could make it to all three.&nbsp;What a thought.</p>
