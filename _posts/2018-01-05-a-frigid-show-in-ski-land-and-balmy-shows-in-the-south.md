title: A FRIGID SHOW IN SKI LAND AND BALMY SHOWS IN THE SOUTH
---

<p>The big snow in New England this week encouraged our friends at Pickle Barrel in Killington, VT to book a special apres ski show for you ski bums on&nbsp;Wednesday, January 18.&nbsp; You saw it here first.&nbsp; Come up and ski with us, then relax in the toasty confines of the old rock club.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are happy to be leaving the snow behind, at least for a week at the end of the month.&nbsp; We have been getting e-mail and Facebook messages begging us to come back to the South.&nbsp; We had to skp the Carolinas this time, but we will make it down there in 2018, we promise.&nbsp; Please check out the calendar&nbsp;HERE&nbsp;for details.&nbsp; From the intimate confines of City Winery in Atlanta to the beautiful outdoor Rock Crusher Pavillion in Crystal River, FL, look for the band to pull out all the stops.&nbsp; You don't want to miss these shows.</p>
