<p>Tribute bands have become a well-recognized facet of the modern-day music scene with groups successfully touring and playing the music of classic artists such as The Eagles, Led Zeppelin, and, of course, The Beatles. The band, The Machine, have parlayed performing the work of Pink Floyd into a flourishing 28-year venture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Friday night at the Cabot Performing Arts Center in Beverly, a sold-out crowd saw just why the foursome of lead singer-guarist Joe Pascarell, keyboardist Scott Chasolen, bassist-vocalist Ryan Ball, and drummer Tahrah Cohen has been drawing hordes of followers to its shows for close to three decades.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From the first moment when a large beam of green light descends on Chasolen during the intro to "Shine On You Crazy Diamond," the scene was set for the ultimate Floyd concert experience - a production that featured background sound effects from the original recordings and an elaborate light show.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Consideirng how much it would cost today to see the actual Pink Floyd on stage (keyboardist Rick Wright passed away in 2008), Friday's show proved a more than worthwhile, and certainly more affordable alternative. The audience was on its feet applauding after just about every song and changed along loudly to "Another Brick in the Wall" and "Wish You Were Here."</p>

<p>At one point, the vintage lyrics "We don't need no education, we don't need no thought control, no dark sarcasm in the classroom..." reverberated throughout the theater like a forceful gale of wind.</p>

<p>The Machine had played The Cabot twice before. That was evident from the appearance of the stage set up and the near-perfect coordination of special effects, which were impactful but not overbearing. You could tell the group had been here before and knew how th manipulate the theater venue to its advantage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We're The Machine, we're from New York City, and we play Pink Floyd music," Pascarell announced after the band finished off a version of "Have a Cigar." That song was Ball's lone turn as lead vocalist, and it brought back memories of British folkie Roy Harper's guest appearance as singer on the original recording.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The show was a sturdy representation of Floyd's career output, from the 1960s Syd Barrett era to the 1980s. Naturally, songs from famous '70s albums Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall were performed with remarkable accuracy. Very rarely did the band deviate from the original arrangements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As well, marvelous renderings of early pieces such as "That Cat's Something I Can't Explain" from Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967) and "Echoes" from Meddle (1971) meshed well with more familiar pieces "Hey You". "Pigs", "Money" and "Young Lust."</p>

<p>The early part of the performance included "Breathe," "On The Run" and "Time." The proceedings would later include "Cymbaline," "Coming Back to Life" and "High Hopes."</p>

<p>Individually, the band mastered the Pink Floyd sound. Pascarell's voice had its share of authenticity but was, at times, very much reminiscent of Roger Waters. His guitar solos were genuine in style while remaining faithful to the original works. Cohen's drums were vigorous and powerful, as was Ball's bass playing. Chasolen's keyboard work was precise yet authentic in its own right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After storming through a boisterous version of "Comfortably Numb: and then exiting the stage, the band re-entered and Pascarell asked viewers to wave as a big spotlight came down on the gathering. Cohen lifted her iPhone and filmed a quick video of the crowd for The Machine's Facebook page.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The night ended appropriately with a rendition of "Eclipse" from Dark Side of the Moon, the song often interpreted as the title track of Pink Floyd's mega-successful album from 1973. It seemed the ideal windup to this three-hour Floydian journey.&nbsp;</p>
