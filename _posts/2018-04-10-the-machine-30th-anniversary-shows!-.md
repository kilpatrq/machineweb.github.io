title: The Machine 30th Anniversary Shows! 
---

<p>At the end of 2018, The Machine will have been a band for 30 years!<br />
For it, we have planned a series of special 30th Anniversary concerts, starting with our very first one in our home venue, Tarrytown Music Hall, coming up on June 9.</p>

<p>The anniversary shows will consist of the band playing THREE consecutive Floyd albums; Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here and Animals, all in one night. &nbsp;No one has tried it before....not one but THREE full albums, with guest musicians on stage so we can do it just right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please join us at Tarrytown Music Hall on June 9, but also check the website for more 30th Anniversary shows HERE. &nbsp;We will be announcing more shows soon, including a 30th anniversary orchestra show with the Buffalo Philharmonic and an unplugged short tour!<br />
