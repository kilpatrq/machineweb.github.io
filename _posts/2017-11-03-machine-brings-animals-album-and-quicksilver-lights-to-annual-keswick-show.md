title: Machine Brings ANIMALS Album and QUICKSILVER LIGHTS to Annual Keswick Show
---

<p>We try to thank our loyal Philly-area fans by coming up with something just a bit different for each year's Keswick Theatre show and 2017 will be no exception.&nbsp; As you can see from the photos, we will be bringing back an expanded version of the Quicksilver Light Show, which debuted at last year's Keswick concert.&nbsp; We will also be performing the&nbsp;<em>Animals</em>&nbsp;album live in its entirety to celebrate its 40th anniversary, along with all of the hits and obscurities you love in a long evening with The Machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Though there are still plenty of good seats left, this show tends to sell out every year, so you might want to get your tickets now while you can.&nbsp; See you at the Keswick on&nbsp;Nov. 24.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
