<blockquote>At the end of 2018, The Machine will have been a band for 30 years!
<p>For it, we have planned a series of special 30th Anniversary concerts, starting with our very first one in our home venue, Tarrytown Music Hall, coming up on June 9.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The anniversary shows will consist of the band playing THREE consecutive Floyd albums;&nbsp;<em>Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here and Animals,&nbsp;</em>all in one night.&nbsp; No one has tried it before....not one but THREE full albums, with guest musicians on stage so we can do it just right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please join us at Tarrytown Music Hall on June 9, but also check the website for more 30th Anniversary shows .&nbsp;We will be announcing more shows soon, including a 30th anniversary orchestra show with the Buffalo Philharmonic and an unplugged short tour!</p>
