title: National Theater postponed to April 16 due to weather
---

<p>We hate to do this, but for everyone's safety, the band and the promoter have been forced by the weather to postpone our Jan. 7 National Theater show in Richmond, VA to Sunday, April 16, with a slightly earlier time of 7:30 p.m. so you can all get home in time to get ready for work.&nbsp; Yep, it's Easter Sunday, so bring the whole family!&nbsp; All tickets for Jan. 7 will be honored at The National on April 16.</p>
